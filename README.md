# Introduction
A deep dive into the data on the job market with a particular focus on business analyst roles. This data analysis project explores üí∏ top-paying jobs, üî• in-demand skills, and üìà where high demand skills meets high salary in business analytics.

üîç SQL queries? They can be found here: [Project_SQL folder](/Project_SQL/)

# Data
Data from https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql

# Tools Used

- **SQL:** SQL was used to query the database allowing me me to extract valuable insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system (DBMS), used for handling the job posting data.
- **Tableau:** Data Visualization tool to display the SQL results to easily understand the results and gain insights.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control, project tracking and displaying my SQL scripts and analysis.

# Analysis 
The queries used were aimed to answer the following questions from the perspective of someone seeking a business analyst position:

1. What are the top-paying business analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for business analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn i.e skills that are in-demand as well as high-paying?

### 1. Top Paying Business Analyst Jobs (Based in TX, or Remote)
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered business analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs or those based in Texas.

```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND 
    ((job_location LIKE '%, TX') OR (job_location = 'Anywhere')) AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

*Key Insights:*

[Bar Chart Visualization](/Data%20Visualization/1_top_paying_business_analyst_jobs.png)

- Salary Range: Top 10 paying business analyst roles span from $162,500 to $220,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

- Diverse Employers: Companies like Noom, Uber, and Multicoin Capital are among those offering these high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries ranging from tech, healthcare to cryptocurrency companies.

- Job Title Variety: There's a high degree of diversity in job titles, from Business Strategy Analyst to Lead Business Intelligence Engineer, reflecting varied roles and specializations within business analytics.

- Location: 7 of the top 10 results from this query are remote jobs, with the other 3 based either in San Antonio or Irving. This suggests that there are in-person opportunities for business analysts in Texas.

### 2. Skills for the top Paying Business Analyst Jobs identified in 1.
To understand which skills are required for the top-paying jobs that we identified in query 1, I joined the job postings with the skills data.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND 
        ((job_location LIKE '%, TX') OR (job_location = 'Anywhere')) AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
*Key Insights:*

[Bar Chart Visualization](/Data%20Visualization/2_top_paying_jobs_skills.png)
[Word Cloud Visualization](/Data%20Visualization/2_word_cloud.png)

- We can clearly see from the two visualizations above that Python is the skill that is the most required in the top-paying Business Analyst roles 
(that we identified earlier) that are either remote or based in Texas. This is followed by SQL, Tableau, and Excel. 
- It appears that Python which is a more complex language to learn than say SQL, is needed for the higher-paying roles. 
- SQL, and Excel are still key skills too as you would expect for a business analyst role.
- This is valuable insight to job seekers that want to pursue a career in Business Analytics as these are the most relevant skills to learn and develop.

### 3. Most in-demand skills for a Business Analyst

This query was used to identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings for a Business Analyst.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
     job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND 
     ((job_location LIKE '%, TX') OR (job_location = 'Anywhere'))
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
